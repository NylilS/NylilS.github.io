                <h3>Hello!, anyone who is viewing this wesbite on microsoft edge. I'm this "beatiful" website's creator, but you already know that.
                    What you want to know are my likes and dislikes and i won't waste your time any further so first i'll have to say I don't like cheese. Yes i know,
                    and your going to think do i like pizza and i do but thats the only exception cheese on anything else just ruins it visually and taste wise and don't
                    get me started on melted cheese you can taste high blood pressure from the smell alone. I also don't like ela due to the simple fact that it i need to be
                    awake to do good at it since it is my first class i am sleepy but if i had math first which I can do in my sleep ela would be a breeze.

                <h3>Lets get one thing out of the way the only thing I like more than anime besides food is the grey ranger in ANY power rangers.
                    If you can't already tell silver is tied with my favorite color green and no mattter what show he's in he always look cooled
                    (to bad he got replaced with the gold ranger). And before i wrap things up my favorite types of characters in any show are either
                    the manipulators and The guy who messes with everyone because he is bored. I love manipulators like Aizen from bleach so much i worked
                    on a website on my own freetime just to talk about them and give them a Gallery.
