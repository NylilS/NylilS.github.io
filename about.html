<h2 style="font-size: 30px;">About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Nylil and i like games especially fighters. I am currently learning how to code in html, and i like small dogs.
    I am pro at some games and I somehow won 250 dollars in a little mini tournament, I also won some money matches. Another
    fact about not just me but my family but all my cousins besides me want to do coding i understand why but i would rather
    do cybersecurity or networking. Finally and most importantly i am probably the pickiest person on this world i have 
    refused almost every food at resturants, buffets, family gatherings i mean it might be probably because what i ate when
    i was younger not anything fancy but since i hated and still hate puting certains foods in the microwave I would eat them 
    cold. I still do this but i ate cold pizza, chicken, i even ate cold rice occasionally but i stop doing that.
