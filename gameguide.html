<h2>Play My Game</h2>
<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">Gameguide</h2>
<h2>The game sadly doesn't have a story mode yet but before you leave there are mechanics that make up for it. Such as my reputation system yes totally not like rip it off
    of blox fruits but unlike that mid game your reputation will make it so you can do certain thing. For example if you wanted to go to the forbidden city(which i am 
    currently working on) you would to have 75-100 good reputation. But if you have a low reputation guards and bounty hunters will hunt you down, if you don't like 
    that don't worryan ex bounty hunter aka the bartender can remove it for you and if you don't need him to do that come back later for something to enhance your perfomance
    or advice. Finally my last piece of advice is that this game can be harsh and you will need some help at times remember you can do certain things in order for different 
    people to join your party.

<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">Inspiration</h2>
<h2> Also before i end this summary and guide the inspiration behind it is yu-gi-oh and Jujutsu kaisen, For example one of the characters is a summoner and can fuse people
    together and i will be adding more fusion methods later on to the game and for Jujutsu kaisen we have the gojo clan and hakari the gambler( if this game gets 10 players
     i'll make either make viltrumites or saiyans).</h2>
